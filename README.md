## Lab Description

The Gauls have really taken to stock trading and trading has become their village pass time. To ensure 
high performance and tolerance to failures, they have decided to adopt modern design practices. 

This project is based on lab 2. You can reuse some of the code you wrote in lab 2 if you want. Your goal 
is to help the Gauls by adding caching, replication, and fault tolerance to the stock bazaar application that were
implemented in the previous labs. Here are some basic requirements:

1.  The stock bazaar application consists of three microservices: a front-end service, a catalog
    service, and an order service.

2.  The front-end service exposes the following REST APIs as they were defined in lab2:

    *   `GET /stocks/<stock_name>`
    *   `POST /orders`

    In addition, the front-end service will provide a new REST API that allows clients to query
    existing orders:

    *   `GET /orders/<order_number>`

        This API returns a JSON reply with a top-level `data` object with the four fields: `number`,
        `name`, `type`, and `quantity`. If the order number doesn't exist, a JSON reply with a
        top-level `error` object should be returned. The `error` object should contain two fields:
        `code` and `message`

    Since in this lab we will focus on higher level concepts, you can use a web framework like
    [`Django`](https://github.com/django/django), [`Flask`](https://github.com/pallets/flask),
    [`Spark`](https://github.com/perwendel/spark) to implement your front-end service. You can also
    reuse the code you wrote in lab 2 if you prefer.

3.  Like in lab 2, you can decide the interfaces used between the microservices. Each microservice
    still need to be able to handle requests concurrently. You can use any concurrency models
    covered in class.

4.  Add some variety to the stock offering by initializing your catalog with at least 10 different
    stocks. Each stock should have an initial volume of 100.

5.  The client first queries the front-end service with a random stock, then it will make a
    follow-up trade request with probability `p` (make `p` an adjustable variable). You can
    decide whether the stock query request and the trade request use the same connection. The
    client will repeat the aforementioned steps for a number of iterations, and record the order
    number and order information if a trade request was successful. Before exiting, the client will
    retrieve the order information of each order that was made using the order query request, and
    check whether the server reply matches the locally stored order information.

## Part 1: Caching

In this part we will add caching to the front-end service to reduce the latency of the stock query
requests. The front-end server starts with an empty in-memory cache. Upon receiving a stock query
request, it first checks the in-memory cache to see whether it can be served from the cache. If not,
the request will then be forwarded to the catalog service, and the result returned by the catalog
service will be stored in the cache.

Cache consistency needs to be addressed whenever a stock is bought or sold. You should implement a
server-push technique: the catalog server sends invalidation requests to the front-end server after each trade. The invalidation requests cause the front-end service to remove the corresponding stock from the cache.

Your cache implementation **must include a cache replacement policy such as LRU (least recently used).**  The cache size should be configurable parameter that is input to the system at start time. To exercise this policy, 
the cache size should be set to a value strictly lower than the number of stocks in the catalog. For example, if your catalog has 15 different stocks, the cache size can be set to 10 to exercise the cache replacement policy. Using a cache size that is larger than the number of items in the catalog should be avoided since it will never trigger cache replacement.

## Part 2: Replication

To make sure that our stock bazaar doesn't lose any order information due to crash failures, we want
to replicate the order service. When you start the stock bazaar application, you should first start
the catalog service. Then you start three replicas of the order service, each with a unique id
number and its own database file. There should always be 1 leader node and the rest are follower
nodes. You do **NOT** need to implement a leader election algorithm. Instead the front-end service
will always try to pick the node with the highest id number as the leader.

When the front-end service starts, it will read the id number and address of each replica of the
order service (this can be done using configuration files/environment variables/command line
parameters). It will ping (here ping means sending a health check request rather than the `ping`
command) the replica with the highest id number to see if it's responsive. If so it will notify all
the replicas that a leader has been selected with the id number, otherwise it will try the replica
with the second highest id number. The process repeats until a leader has been found.

When a trade request or an order query request arrives, the front-end service only forwards the
request to the leader. In case of a successful trade (a new order number is generated), the leader
node will propagate the information of the new order to the follower nodes to maintain data
consistency.

## Part 3: Fault Tolerance

In this part you will handle failures of the order service. In this lab you only need to deal with
crash failure tolerance rather than Byzantine failure tolerance.

First We want to make sure that when any replica crashes (including the leader), trade requests and
order query requests can still be handled and return the correct result. To achieve this, when the
front-end service finds that the leader node is unresponsive, it will redo the leader selection
algorithm as described in [Part2](#part-2-replication).

We also want to make sure that when a crashed replica is back online, it can synchronize with the
other replicas to retrieve the order information that it has missed during the offline time. When a
replica comes back online from a crash, it will look at its database file and get the latest order
number that it has and ask the other replicas what orders it has missed since that order number.

## Part 4: Testing and Evaluation with Deployment on AWS

First, write some simple test cases to verify that your code works as expected. You should test both
each individual microservice as well as the whole application. Submit your test cases and test
output in a test directory.

Next, deploy the entire application as AWS instance. We suggest you deploy your entire application on a `t2.medium` instance in the `us-east-1` region on AWS. You are welcome to choose other instance type if you so wish. We will provide instructions on how to do this in lablet 5.

When deploying the entire application on a **single AWS instance**, each microservice can be deployed as a separate container or a separate process. Note that each replication of the catalog will also be a seperate container/process. Each service has its own database, including the replicas which have separate databases on the cloud server. 

Run 5 clients on your local machine. Measure
the latency seen by each client for different types of requests. Change the probability p of a
follow up trade request from 0 to 80%, with an increment of 20%, and record the result for each p
setting. Make simple plots showing the values of p on the X-axis and the latency of different types
of request on the y-axis. Also do the same experiments but with caching turned off, estimate how
much benefits does caching provide by comparing the results.  Further, show cache replacement in action by 
showing what items are cached over time and how items get replaced based on your replacement policy (e.g., LRU).

Finally, simulate crash failures by killing a random order service replica while the client is
running, and then bring it back online after some time. Repeat this experiment several times and
make sure that you test the case when the leader is killed. Can the clients notice the failures?
(either during order requests or the final order checking phase) or are they transparent to the
clients? Do all the order service replicas end up with the same database file?

##  Part 5: Optional part for Extra Credit -  Consensus using Paxos

This part is optional and may be attempted for extra credit. This part can take significant effort and you should attempt it **only if the rest of your lab is complete and in good shape. Limited partial credits will be given for incorrect implementation** 

Assume that the order service is replicated on three nodes. Implement a Paxos consensus protocol to make sure that all replicas can order incoming writes and apply them to the database in the same order. This will ensure that race conditions do not occur where concurrent incoming orders go to two different replicas and get applied to the other replicas in different orders. You need to implement proposer (leader), acceptor, and learner. Furthermore, you will need to keep track of the proposal number. You will further need to show that failures of a order replica does not prevent the others from making progress since the majority of the replicas (2 out of 3) are still up.  The extra credit part is worth 15 points.


## What to submit

At the top of this README file add the name(s) and umass email address(es) of all the team members.
Also if you are working in a group, briefly describe how the work is divided.

You solution should contain source code for both parts separately. Inside the src directory, you
should have a separate folder for each component/microservice, e.g., a `client` folder for client
code, a `front-end` folder for the front-end service, etc.

A short README file on how to run your code. Include build/make files if you created any, otherwise
the README instructions on running the code should provide details on how to do so.

Submit the following additional documents inside the docs directory. 1) A Brief design document (
2 to 3 pages) that explains your design choices (include citations, if you used referred to Internet
sources), 2) An Output file (1 to 2 pages), showing sample output or screenshots to indicate your
program works, and 3) An Evaluation doc (2 to 3 pages), for part 4 showing plots and making
observations.  

If you attempted the extra credit part, include a separate source code folder for this part and also include it in the design doc and show sample output.
