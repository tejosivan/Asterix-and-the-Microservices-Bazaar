Fault Tolerance Test Results
=========================

Setting up replication environment
--------------------------------
Stopping any existing order service processes
Started replica 0 (PID: 74634)
Started replica 1 (PID: 74635)
Started replica 2 (PID: 74636)
Waiting for replicas to initialize...

Test 1: Baseline client operation
------------------------------
Baseline client completed successfully
Client made 13 successful trades
Baseline latencies - Lookup: 0.003202493374164288s, Trade: 0.002726921668419471s, Order: 0.0024631206805889425s

Test 2: Kill follower (replica 0)
------------------------------
Killed follower replica 0 (PID: 74634)
Client completed successfully after follower failure
Client made 13 successful trades after follower failure
Latencies after follower failure - Lookup: 0.0022203922271728516s, Trade: 0.0035451742318960335s, Order: 0.012930998435387244s

Test 3: Restart follower (replica 0)
--------------------------------
Restarted follower replica 0 (PID: 74757)
Waiting for follower to synchronize...

Test 4: Kill leader (replica 2)
----------------------------
Killed leader replica 2 (PID: 74636)
Waiting for new leader election...
Client completed successfully after leader failure
Client made 5 successful trades after leader failure
Latencies after leader failure - Lookup: 0.002830648422241211s, Trade: 0.0030691146850585936s, Order: 0.002966499328613281s

Test 5: Restart leader (replica 2)
------------------------------
Restarted leader replica 2 (PID: 74912)
Waiting for leader to synchronize...
Latencies after leader recovery - Lookup: 0.002652078866958618s, Trade: 0.0029906034469604492s, Order: 0.0027064085006713867s

Test 6: Check database consistency
-------------------------------
Database file for replica 0 not found
Database file for replica 1 not found
Database file for replica 2 not found
Not enough replica databases found to compare consistency

Fault Tolerance Test Conclusions
------------------------------
1. Did clients notice follower failures? No, failures were transparent
2. Did clients notice leader failures? No, failures were transparent
