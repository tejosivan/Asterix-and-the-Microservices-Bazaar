Fault Tolerance Test Results
=========================

Setting up replication environment
--------------------------------
Stopping any existing order service processes
Started replica 0 (PID: 41703)
Started replica 1 (PID: 41704)
Started replica 2 (PID: 41705)
Waiting for replicas to initialize...

Test 1: Baseline client operation
------------------------------
Baseline client completed successfully
Client made 6 successful trades
Baseline latencies - Lookup: 0.002020597457885742s, Trade: 0.0025654236475626626s, Order: 0.0026163657506306968s

Test 2: Kill follower (replica 0)
------------------------------
Killed follower replica 0 (PID: 41703)
Client completed successfully after follower failure
Client made 9 successful trades after follower failure
Latencies after follower failure - Lookup: 0.0021888415018717446s, Trade: 0.003141588634914822s, Order: 0.0026428434583875868s

Test 3: Restart follower (replica 0)
--------------------------------
Restarted follower replica 0 (PID: 41826)
Waiting for follower to synchronize...

Test 4: Kill leader (replica 2)
----------------------------
Killed leader replica 2 (PID: 41705)
Waiting for new leader election...
Client completed successfully after leader failure
Client made 7 successful trades after leader failure
Latencies after leader failure - Lookup: 0.0019082001277378627s, Trade: 0.0027963093348911832s, Order: 0.003413234438214983s

Test 5: Restart leader (replica 2)
------------------------------
Restarted leader replica 2 (PID: 41975)
Waiting for leader to synchronize...
Latencies after leader recovery - Lookup: 0.002122368131365095s, Trade: 0.0024871826171875s, Order: 0.002787249428885324s

Test 6: Check database consistency
-------------------------------
Database file for replica 0 not found
Database file for replica 1 not found
Database file for replica 2 not found
Not enough replica databases found to compare consistency

Fault Tolerance Test Conclusions
------------------------------
1. Did clients notice follower failures? No, failures were transparent
2. Did clients notice leader failures? No, failures were transparent
