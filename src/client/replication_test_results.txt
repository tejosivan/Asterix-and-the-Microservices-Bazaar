Fault Tolerance Test Results
=========================

Setting up replication environment
--------------------------------
Stopping any existing order service processes
Started replica 0 (PID: 76239)
Started replica 1 (PID: 76240)
Started replica 2 (PID: 76241)
Waiting for replicas to initialize...

Test 1: Baseline client operation
------------------------------
Baseline client completed successfully
Client made 10 successful trades
Baseline latencies - Lookup: 0.002624177932739258s, Trade: 0.0048446178436279295s, Order: 0.0044537544250488285s

Test 2: Kill follower (replica 0)
------------------------------
Killed follower replica 0 (PID: 76239)
Client completed successfully after follower failure
Client made 6 successful trades after follower failure
Latencies after follower failure - Lookup: 0.003427306811014811s, Trade: 0.0050468842188517255s, Order: 0.005825956662495931s

Test 3: Restart follower (replica 0)
--------------------------------
Restarted follower replica 0 (PID: 76382)
Waiting for follower to synchronize...

Test 4: Kill leader (replica 2)
----------------------------
Killed leader replica 2 (PID: 76241)
Waiting for new leader election...
Client completed successfully after leader failure
Client made 6 successful trades after leader failure
Latencies after leader failure - Lookup: 0.003498037656148275s, Trade: 0.004489580790201823s, Order: 0.005459427833557129s

Test 5: Restart leader (replica 2)
------------------------------
Restarted leader replica 2 (PID: 76506)
Waiting for leader to synchronize...
Latencies after leader recovery - Lookup: 0.0022753987993512836s, Trade: 0.003018719809395926s, Order: 0.004623923982892718s

Test 6: Check database consistency
-------------------------------
Database file for replica 0 not found
Database file for replica 1 not found
Database file for replica 2 not found
Not enough replica databases found to compare consistency

Fault Tolerance Test Conclusions
------------------------------
1. Did clients notice follower failures? No, failures were transparent
2. Did clients notice leader failures? No, failures were transparent
