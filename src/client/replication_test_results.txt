Fault Tolerance Test Results
=========================

Setting up replication environment
--------------------------------
Stopping any existing order service processes
Started replica 0 (PID: 79044)
Started replica 1 (PID: 79045)
Started replica 2 (PID: 79046)
Waiting for replicas to initialize...

Test 1: Baseline client operation
------------------------------
Baseline client completed successfully
Client made 5 successful trades
Baseline latencies - Lookup: 0.0028087615966796873s, Trade: 0.004469394683837891s, Order: 0.0051348209381103516s

Test 2: Kill follower (replica 0)
------------------------------
Killed follower replica 0 (PID: 79044)
Client completed successfully after follower failure
Client made 8 successful trades after follower failure
Latencies after follower failure - Lookup: 0.0022289156913757324s, Trade: 0.0028244853019714355s, Order: 0.004724740982055664s

Test 3: Restart follower (replica 0)
--------------------------------
Restarted follower replica 0 (PID: 79184)
Waiting for follower to synchronize...

Test 4: Kill leader (replica 2)
----------------------------
Killed leader replica 2 (PID: 79046)
Waiting for new leader election...
Client completed successfully after leader failure
Client made 7 successful trades after leader failure
Latencies after leader failure - Lookup: 0.006856169019426618s, Trade: 0.0104283264705113s, Order: 0.00747854369027274s

Test 5: Restart leader (replica 2)
------------------------------
Restarted leader replica 2 (PID: 79312)
Waiting for leader to synchronize...
Latencies after leader recovery - Lookup: 0.0029389560222625732s, Trade: 0.0031284987926483154s, Order: 0.00544893741607666s

Test 6: Check database consistency
-------------------------------
Database file for replica 0 not found
Database file for replica 1 not found
Database file for replica 2 not found
Not enough replica databases found to compare consistency

Fault Tolerance Test Conclusions
------------------------------
1. Did clients notice follower failures? No, failures were transparent
2. Did clients notice leader failures? No, failures were transparent
