Fault Tolerance Test Results
=========================

Setting up replication environment
--------------------------------
Stopping any existing order service processes
Started replica 0 (PID: 93566)
Started replica 1 (PID: 93567)
Started replica 2 (PID: 93568)
Waiting for replicas to initialize...

Test 1: Baseline client operation
------------------------------
Baseline client completed successfully
Client made 7 successful trades
Baseline latencies - Lookup: 0.02484018462044852s, Trade: 0.6556788853236607s, Order: 0.012080635343279158s

Test 2: Kill follower (replica 0)
------------------------------
Killed follower replica 0 (PID: 93566)
Client completed successfully after follower failure
Client made 7 successful trades after follower failure
Latencies after follower failure - Lookup: 0.002529961722237723s, Trade: 0.007441146033150809s, Order: 0.005274738584245954s

Test 3: Restart follower (replica 0)
--------------------------------
Restarted follower replica 0 (PID: 93747)
Waiting for follower to synchronize...

Test 4: Kill leader (replica 2)
----------------------------
Killed leader replica 2 (PID: 93568)
Waiting for new leader election...
Client completed successfully after leader failure
Client made 9 successful trades after leader failure
Latencies after leader failure - Lookup: 0.002016464869181315s, Trade: 0.003021876017252604s, Order: 0.005476660198635525s

Test 5: Restart leader (replica 2)
------------------------------
Restarted leader replica 2 (PID: 93923)
Waiting for leader to synchronize...
Latencies after leader recovery - Lookup: 0.0019342558724539621s, Trade: 0.002542257308959961s, Order: 0.0085275513785226s

Test 6: Check database consistency
-------------------------------
Database file for replica 0 not found
Database file for replica 1 not found
Database file for replica 2 not found
Not enough replica databases found to compare consistency

Fault Tolerance Test Conclusions
------------------------------
1. Did clients notice follower failures? No, failures were transparent
2. Did clients notice leader failures? No, failures were transparent
