Fault Tolerance Test Results
=========================

Setting up replication environment
--------------------------------
Stopping any existing order service processes
Error stopping processes: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
Started replica 0 (PID: 12004)
Started replica 1 (PID: 18604)
Started replica 2 (PID: 7992)
Waiting for replicas to initialize...

Test 1: Baseline client operation
------------------------------
Baseline client completed successfully
Client made 9 successful trades
Baseline latencies - Lookup: 2.070439020792643s, Trade: 2.0886796050601535s, Order: 2.065218687057495s

Test 2: Kill follower (replica 0)
------------------------------
Killed follower replica 0 (PID: 12004)
Client completed successfully after follower failure
Client made 9 successful trades after follower failure
Latencies after follower failure - Lookup: 2.0549479590521917s, Trade: 2.0902231534322104s, Order: 2.061588684717814s

Test 3: Restart follower (replica 0)
--------------------------------
Restarted follower replica 0 (PID: 12720)
Waiting for follower to synchronize...

Test 4: Kill leader (replica 2)
----------------------------
Killed leader replica 2 (PID: 7992)
Waiting for new leader election...
Client completed successfully after leader failure
Client made 6 successful trades after leader failure
Latencies after leader failure - Lookup: 2.049670139948527s, Trade: 2.1081513166427612s, Order: 2.065588593482971s

Test 5: Restart leader (replica 2)
------------------------------
Restarted leader replica 2 (PID: 20084)
Waiting for leader to synchronize...
Latencies after leader recovery - Lookup: 2.0522034565607705s, Trade: 2.1019978523254395s, Order: 2.0609395503997803s

Test 6: Check database consistency
-------------------------------
Database file for replica 0 not found
Database file for replica 1 not found
Database file for replica 2 not found
Not enough replica databases found to compare consistency

Fault Tolerance Test Conclusions
------------------------------
1. Did clients notice follower failures? No, failures were transparent
2. Did clients notice leader failures? No, failures were transparent
